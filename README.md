## Documentation

The full documentation for this project is also available as an `mdBook`. It provides a structured guide with additional information, resources, and interactive content for each module.

To view the documentation, either clone the `mdBook` and run it locally or access the hosted version via the following link:

- [Multi-Task Learning `mdBook`](link/to/mdbook)

You can build and serve the `mdBook` locally by running:
   ```bash
   mdbook build
   mdbook serve --open
   ```

This will open the book in your web browser for easy navigation through the course materials.
